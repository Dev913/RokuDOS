# RokuDOS
This is a python script that will send requests to a Roku Smart television and spam the home button.

# WARNING
Once this is executed, this can cause a lasting effect. That is until you unplug and plug the Roku device back in to your power source. This was only tested on a Roku 65" so it may only affect those. However, do not quote me on that.

## Instructions
* First before executing add sudo before "python RokuDOS.py".
* After first execution proceed to press ctrl + z after everything installed and you see an error about the roku script.
* Re-execute the script using "python3 RokuDOS.py".
* In order to gain an IP you need to have access to the network that the Roku is connected to.
* You can use many different applications. I reccommend nmap it is fast.
* Head to https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/.
* Read and enter the command gather the IP of the Roku TV or TV's and enter them into the RokuDOS script when asked and profit.
